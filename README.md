//***Gesture controlled robot car using Arduino UNO and Accelerometer.***//
Add the VirtualWire library to your Arduino IDE library folder.
Readings of accelerometer has to be studied in real time to obtain range for each direction.Given ranges is dependent on hardware and other factors.
Small time lag between gesture and corresponding action will be present.It has been reduced as much as possible.
